# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based approaches in natural language processing.

## What is RAG?

RAG combines:
1. Retrieval of relevant context from a knowledge base (vector database)
2. Generation using an LLM conditioned on that retrieved context

This helps the model answer with grounded, domain-specific information rather than relying solely on its training data.

## How RAG Works

The RAG process typically involves:
1. User query: "What is the capital of France?"
2. Retriever: Searches vector database for relevant documents
3. Context: Retrieved chunks are formatted as context
4. Prompt: "Use this context: [documents] to answer: What is the capital of France?"
5. Generator: LLM uses context to generate accurate answer: "Paris"

## Benefits of RAG

- Reduces hallucination by grounding responses in actual documents
- Allows updating knowledge without retraining the LLM
- Supports domain-specific applications
- Improves factual accuracy and traceability

## RAG Architecture Components

### Vector Database
Stores embeddings of documents for semantic search. Examples: Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus.

### Embeddings Model
Converts text to vectors. Examples: OpenAI embeddings, Google Gemini embeddings, Sentence Transformers.

### Retriever
Performs semantic search to find relevant documents. Usually top-k nearest neighbors.

### Language Model
Generates responses based on context. Examples: GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Llama.

### Orchestrator
Manages the workflow. LangChain is a popular choice for this.
